Limitation of this program:

1. For complex model such as horse, armband, man, etc., the maximum number of decimated edges is limited(as the chart below). Exceeding this limit will cause fold-overs of faces, and the program will crush.
2. ***You need to quit and run again if you want to open another smf file or start another decimation

Some test cases--

To run the program:
1. run ./WORKSPACE/Build/Products/Debug/mcaq
2. open smf file
3. Use key "W S A D" to translate
4. Use key "E R" to zoom in/out
5. Drag the object to rotate
6. Use the spinners in "Decimate" panel to choose the degree k for multiple choice and the number of edges to collapse.
7. Clik "Decimate" to start decimation
8. Use Save button to convert winged-edge data back to smf file. The output smf file will be stored at "/tmp/output.smf"
8. ***You need to quit and run again if you want to open another smf file or start another decimation

To compile:
1.open mcaq.xcodeproj
2.click Product > Run. It takes roughly 30 seconds if built from scratch.
3.The products will be located at:WORKSPACE/Build/Products/Debug/

To clean:
1.click Product > Clean
